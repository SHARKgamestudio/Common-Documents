# @SHARKstudio Licensing Guide
Every piece of software I produce, either individually or as part of a team, is subject to a **license** file, which defines the permissions, restrictions, and obligations for its use.

> ⚠️ Be careful: *`custom license files`* are not fully custom legal licenses.
> Each file is a renamed version of a real, official license (such as MIT, GPL, etc.),
> sometimes with minor adjustments to make them more suitable for software (for example, adapted Creative Commons licenses).
> The main purpose is to make it easier and faster to find a license that matches my specific needs.

By using my work, you acknowledge that you have **read, understood, and accepted** the corresponding license attached.

Any use of my work without adhering to the specified license terms is strictly prohibited.  
Failure to comply **will** result in legal action.

## SHARK Permission Identifiers
At the end of each SHARK license file name, you will find a set of **three letters**.

These letters serve as identifiers that describe the core rules of the license.

---

### **First Letter – Source Access**
- **O (Open)** – Open Source  
- **A (Available)** – Source Available  
- **C (Closed)** – Closed Source  
- **R (Restricted)** – Restricted Access  

---

### **Second Letter – Redistribution**
- **A (Any)** – Redistribution Allowed  
- **N (Non-Commercial)** – Redistribution Allowed for Non-Commercial Use Only  
- **P (Prohibited)** – Redistribution Prohibited  

---

### **Third Letter – Credit Requirements**
- **N (None)** – No credits required (for use or redistribution)  
- **R (Redistribution)** – Credits required only for redistribution
- **A (All)** – Credits required for both usage and redistribution  

---

## SHARK Flag Identifiers
In addition to the three-letter identifiers, you may also encounter **flags** at the end of a license file name.  

These flags are **optional** and provide extra context about the project’s development status.  
Most commonly, they indicate whether a repository is open to collaboration or contributions.  

> ⚠️ Note: Flags are mainly used for my own **personal organization**.  
> Not all flags are publicly documented.

---

### **Example Flags**
- **C** – Collaborative (open to contributions)  
- **NC** – Non-Collaborative (not open to contributions)  
- **WIP** – Work in Progress (still under development)  
- **EXP** – Experiment project (for fun, likely discontinued)  
- **ETC** – Other miscellaneous flags may be used as needed

## Example License Breakdown
For example, a license file named `LICENSE_SHARK_OAN_C.md` can be broken down as follows:
- **O** – Open Source: The source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.  
- **A** – Redistribution Allowed: You can redistribute the software without any restrictions.
- **N** – No Credits Required: You are not required to give credit to the original author when using or redistributing the software.
- **C** – Collaborative: The project is open to contributions from the community.

In short, this means you can use, modify, and share the software freely without needing to credit the original author, and you are welcome to contribute to its development.
